# fovus-coding-react-app
Short Description: 
I developed a comprehensive full-stack web application, leveraging **React JS** for the front-end and various **AWS services** for back-end functionalities. The application features a responsive user interface designed with React, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

On the back end, I integrated several AWS services to achieve scalability and reliability:
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless computing to efficiently handle requests.
- **Amazon S3** for secure file storage.
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for NoSQL database management.

I also implemented **RESTful APIs** to enable smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This project allowed me to showcase my expertise in **modern web technologies**, cloud platforms, and **RESTful architecture**, while highlighting my ability to integrate cloud solutions into real-world applications
